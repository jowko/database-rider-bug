# Database-rider bug on Jakarta

This example project shows issue with database-rider and Jakarta. In this setup, test data is not inserted
either by DataSet annotation or programmatically.

There is already issue for supporting that: https://github.com/database-rider/database-rider/issues/565

You can debug this issue by switching between first commit (Java EE variant) or second commit (Jakarta with
additional fixes in database-rider).
